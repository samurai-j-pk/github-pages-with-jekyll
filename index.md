# _**Samurai-j-pk says:**_

I plan to talk about my journey towards becoming an operational, self-sustaining and self-sufficient coder, doing data analysis tasks related to trading, i.e. automization, modelling and optimization. Basically, becoming a ronin-style kungfu-master, trained in the martial arts of data science.

Talk is cheap, action and results speak for themselves. My plan for this blog is to  post results from projects here, once i get to the level of actual postable projects. In the meantime, this will just be a training area for handlig GitHub. 

Also, I'm not yet convinced GitHub is the best means of floating a blog. I might end up moving it. But for now... Here we go...!


(PS: Yes, I do know japanese bushido is not the same as chinese kungfu... but sam-jack, an ecclectic pragmatist and a worthy role model, was trained in both.)


I'll be back soon. Cheers!
