# Data-KungFu

I plan to talk about my journey towards becoming an operational, self-sustaining and self-sufficient coder, doing data analysis tasks related to trading, i.e. modelling and optimization. Basically, becoming a ronin-style kungfu-master, trained in the martial arts of data science.

Talk is cheap, action and results speak for themselves. Plan is to here post results from projects, once i get to the level of actual postable projects. In the meantime, this will just be a training area for handlig GitHub.

(PS: Yes, I do know japanese bushido is not the same as chinese kungfu... but sam-jack, an ecclectic pragmatist and a worthy role model, was trained in both.)


I'll be back soon. Cheers!
